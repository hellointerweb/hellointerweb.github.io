Well, it is a new year, and that is a fact that cannot be argued. In the spirit of of succumbing to the positive voice of change, I want to try to be more mindful and attentive within 2022. I don't think it is a particularly hard concept: "Do what you say you are going to do". That is what I think this means at it's core. I want to be less distracted, and more focused, streamlined if you will. I have a tremendous amount of brainpower at my disposal and I think I am a force to be reckoned with at times..

"Why are ecosystems/platforms like stake and roobet important to the overall success of cryptocurrency?"

The first question to answer is really more preliminary tham the question posed in the title. The problem in today's day and age, the common man or women simply do not understand the importance of fiat currency more commonly known as a "cryptocurrency". First the average joe must understand and support the argument for the necessity of a form of payment that functions without the crutch of a central monetary authority, like a bank.

"What am I doing?"

These words have been pounding in my head lately, and when I say pounding, I mean pounding quite similarly to a sledgehammer slamming into old concrete. Within the last 24 hours I have started talking to an old flame again. My oldest flame, and most passionate. I'm not really sure what I'm doing or what my goal is, but I do know that I missed talking to her, and that it was almost therapeutic pouring our hearts out to each for one more time. There is definitely something still there for us, lurking just beneath whatever facade either of us has put up for the day. 

Quick break for what I want to do today: 
- Learn about making infographics 
- Do some crypto research for the RBC 
- Clean house/room
- Talk to G more 
- research creating NFTs

Update: Just realized I have yet to eat today

Hello there folks. I'd like to imagine that all of my fans were losing their shit over their beloved blog writer not posting for a month. Haha, it would be nice to have a following, but I am merely a vessel that very little care about. Which is fine by me- the smaller the circle the less loss. 

A month it has been since my last spewing of words onto the immortal page. Has my life gotten better or worse, you ask? That remains to be seen. I am making more money, and doing more, which I think deserves a congratulations in of itself. But more work remains to be done. I need to work on myself- on the small things to improve my quality of life. I still feel like as a person I leave a lot to be desired. I am lazy, I know that is a certainy. Similarly, I get distracted very easily. Recently an idea called "monotasking" has been presented to me. I know I'm a list guy, but lists even can draw on and lose their effectivity. Make short lists with the purpose of only focusing on those specific items for the day. Repeat.

I need to do laundry. I know that my depression, or anxiety or anxiety or whatever foul beast that resides in my head presents itself in the form of me washing and taking care of my clothes and appearance. It feels almost neurotic to me sometimes. I wash my clothes, they end up on the floor, I separate them into piles, and then I just don't put them away. I get distracted, I say I will do it later, someone walks into my room, whatever the distraction may be- I just don't do it.

I'm trying to use this page as an excercise for (excuse the word) penetrating self examination. How am I to succeed in this world if I do not first understand every devious little thing about myself? I am the one person I will always have to depend on, I should be able to trust myself without any misgivings.

**What is a day that you wish you could relive?**

A day that I wish I could relive. What an interesting, impossible question. In the wide span that is my life (so-far) there has been thousands and thousands of days, all merged into one existential blur that is time. The greedy part of me wants to answer this question by stating the words, "Simple. I would want to relive every day. Life and my person is something that I care about more than almost anything in this world." Radical honesty. That is the key here- there must be a day that I wish I could relive, one that is apart from the rest. My memory isn't that great, if I'm being honest. To answer this question I'm going to take a rather empathetic and caring stance- I would like to relive a day when my father was happy. It is so rare to see him smiling, and carefree. The troubles of life have burdened him greatly, like the modern Sisyphus in the fields of Asphodel. I want him to be loved, to feel loved, and to love back. I want him to finally be able to rest, and enjoy himself. This is why my own shortcomings hurt me so badly- because I know they affect my loved ones greatly.

Alcohol is great in the moment- not the next morning. Coffee, and greasy food.

The problem, when dealing with someone like me is that I have a love for absoluteness. Ever since I was a kid, the idea that things could live and die absolutely drove me crazy. To the point where I started believing that life itself was some sort of sadistic joke forced upon those who were brought into this life. I couldn't fathom the possiblity that this 'world' and I say that in loose terms, would inflict the kind of existiential angst on all those who are blessed with a conscience. Couple the human condition with the horrible aspects of the modern world, and you recieve something that feels a bit like hell. The average human is almost forced into slavery by something along the lines of what I like to call 'indentured capitalism'. You don/'t have a damn choice- you need to work, or you die.

Since creating this, I have been thinking quite a lot about posting on here. If you want a little update about my life- currently I am juggling two gung ho bosses who believe my one calling in life is to be at their beck and call. Sadly, that is the opposite of what I want or need. I need transparency, good communication, and clarity within my business. I don't recieve that from any end. Is it so hard in captilast America to actually be clear and concise with your work??? I personally do not.

This will be my first time posting on this website. I want to treat it similar to a blog, a personal confession, if you will. This is falling into my ideal of treating everyone and everything to a certain level of radical honesty. For some reason it just feels easier to openly talk to the world behind a guise of anonymity, but hey- no one is perfect.
