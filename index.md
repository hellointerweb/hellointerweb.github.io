**What is a day that you wish you could relive?**

A day that I wish I could relive. What an interesting, impossible question. In the wide span that is my life (so-far) there has been thousands and thousands of days, all merged into one existential blur that is time. The greedy part of me wants to answer this question by stating the words, "Simple. I would want to relive every day. Life and my person is something that I care about more than almost anything in this world." Radical honesty. That is the key here- there must be a day that I wish I could relive, one that is apart from the rest. My memory isn't that great, if I'm being honest. To answer this question I'm going to take a rather empathetic and caring stance- I would like to relive a day when my father was happy. It is so rare to see him smiling, and carefree. The troubles of life have burdened him greatly, like the modern Sisyphus in the fields of Asphodel. I want him to be loved, to feel loved, and to love back. I want him to finally be able to rest, and enjoy himself. This is why my own shortcomings hurt me so badly- because I know they affect my loved ones greatly.

Alcohol is great in the moment- not the next morning. Coffee, and greasy food.

The problem, when dealing with someone like me is that I have a love for absoluteness. Ever since I was a kid, the idea that things could live and die absolutely drove me crazy. To the point where I started believing that life itself was some sort of sadistic joke forced upon those who were brought into this life. I couldn't fathom the possiblity that this 'world' and I say that in loose terms, would inflict the kind of existiential angst on all those who are blessed with a conscience. Couple the human condition with the horrible aspects of the modern world, and you recieve something that feels a bit like hell. The average human is almost forced into slavery by something along the lines of what I like to call 'indentured capitalism'. You don/'t have a damn choice- you need to work, or you die.

Since creating this, I have been thinking quite a lot about posting on here. If you want a little update about my life- currently I am juggling two gung ho bosses who believe my one calling in life is to be at their beck and call. Sadly, that is the opposite of what I want or need. I need transparency, good communication, and clarity within my business. I don't recieve that from any end. Is it so hard in captilast America to actually be clear and concise with your work??? I personally do not.

This will be my first time posting on this website. I want to treat it similar to a blog, a personal confession, if you will. This is falling into my ideal of treating everyone and everything to a certain level of radical honesty. For some reason it just feels easier to openly talk to the world behind a guise of anonymity, but hey- no one is perfect.
