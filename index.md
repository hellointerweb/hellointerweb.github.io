## Hello InterWeb

This a 100 percent unredacted, non-compromised, unbiased, extremely in-depth take of the world from a young man living in Nevada. All you need to know is that I am a college student abhored by the state of the world that we live in.

The problem, when dealing with someone like me is that I have a love for absoluteness. Ever since I was a kid, the idea that things could live and die absolutely drove me crazy. To the point where I started believing that life itself was some sort of sadistic joke forced upon those who were brought into this life. I couldn't fathom the possiblity that this 'world' and I say that in loose terms, would inflict the kind of existiential angst on all those who are blessed with a conscience. Couple the human condition with the horrible aspects of the modern world, and you recieve something that feels a bit like hell. The average human is almost forced into slavery by something along the lines of what I like to call 'indentured capitalism'. You don/'t have a damn choice- you need to work, or you die.

Since creating this, I have been thinking quite a lot about posting on here. If you want a little update about my life- currently I am juggling two gung ho bosses who believe my one calling in life is to be at their beck and call. Sadly, that is the opposite of what I want or need. I need transparency, good communication, and clarity within my business. I don't recieve that from any end. Is it so hard in captilast America to actually be clear and concise with your work??? I personally do not.

This will be my first time posting on this website. I want to treat it similar to a blog, a personal confession, if you will. This is falling into my ideal of treating everyone and everything to a certain level of radical honesty. For some reason it just feels easier to openly talk to the world behind a guise of anonymity, but hey- no one is perfect.
