## Hello InterWeb

This a 100 percent unredacted, non-compromised, unbiased, extremely in-depth take of the world from a young man living in Nevada. All you need to know is that I am a college student abhored by the state of the world that we live in.

This will be my first time posting on this website. I want to treat it similar to a blog, a personal confession, if you will. This is falling into my ideal of treating everyone and everything to a certain level of radical honesty. For some reason it just feels easier to openly talk to the world behind a guise of anonymity, but hey- no one is perfect.
